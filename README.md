# Inferential-Statistics
This is a project of descriptive statistics and a statistical test on a data set based on [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).

# Purpose
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. I hope to review the basic concepts of statistics, including:
1. Identify components of an experiment
2. Use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
3. Set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
